# PulseTransfer
**Maintainer**: Simon Spannagel (simon.spannagel@cern.ch)  
**Status**: Functional  
**Input**: PropagatedCharge  
**Output**: PixelCharge

### Description
Combines individual induced charge pulses generated by propagated charges to one total pulse per pixel. This prepares the pulse for processing in the front-end electronics.

Pulse graph for every pixel seeing a signal is generated if `output_pulsegraphs` is enabled. One graph depicts the induced charge per time step of the simulation, i.e. the current, while the second graph shows the accumulated charge since the beginning of the event.
It should be noted that generating per-pixel pulses will generate several pulse graphs per event and might result in a slow-down of the simulation process as well as a large module root file.

### Parameters
* `output_plots` : Determines if simple output plots such as the total and per-pixel induced charge should be generated for a monitoring of the simulation flow. Disabled by default.
* `output_plots_scale` : Set the x-axis scale of the output histograms, defaults to 30ke.
* `output_plots_bins` : Set the number of bins for the output histograms, defaults to 100.
* `output_pulsegraphs`: Determines if pulse graphs should be generated for every event. This creates several graphs per event, depending on how many pixels see a signal, and can slow down the simulation. It is not recommended to enable this option for runs with more than a couple of events. Disabled by default.

### Usage
The default configuration is equal to the following:

```toml
[PulseTransfer]
```
